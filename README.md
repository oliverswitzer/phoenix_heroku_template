# Phoenix Template App 

### ‚ô®Ô∏è  This is a boilerplate template for Phoenix apps that can be deployed to Heroku

This boilerplate app uses:

* Phoenix 1.6.3
* elixir 1.12.3-otp-24
* erlang 24.1
* LiveView
* esbuild
* Ecto / Postgres 

# üõ†  Setup & Customzie

To quickly make this boilerplate yours, I've provided a setup script that makes
it a breeze to rename this app to your desired named.

Just run `./setup.sh` and follow the prompts!

If you'd prefer to do the renames manually, feel free to follow along
[here](#manual-app-rename)

# üêø  Deployment

Minor changes have been made to `config/runtime.exs` to allow deployments to Heroku.
All you need to do is install the necessary buildpacks and set appropriate environment variables.

1. Create heroku app

`heroku create <your-app-name>`

2. Install buildpacks

`heroku buildpacks:add hashnuke/elixir`

By default, Phoenix uses esbuild and manages all assets for you. However, if you are using node and npm, you will need to install the Phoenix Static buildpack to handle them:

`heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static.git`

3. Set these env vars:

```
heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=<database url generated from heroku>
heroku config:set POOL_SIZE=10
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(mix phx.gen.secret)
heroku config:set PHX_HOST=<your heroku domain>
```

4. (Optional) Enable Github Actions for Continuous Deployment

This repository has already defined a very simple Github action workflow that
deploys commits to main to Heroku in `.github/workflows/main.yml`

To enable this, simply edit `.github/workflows/main.yml`, add your email address, and change `replace_me` to your apps name. Finally, set `HEROKU_API_KEY` in your Github repository secrets.

# üîé Other considerations

If you'd prefer not to use a database, it is relatively easy to disable Ecto; just comment out `RenameMe.Repo,` in `lib/rename_me/application.ex` so it doesn't yell at you when starting up the app.

If you hate the long spin up time that Heroku has for its dynos check out this
cool tool to keep your Heroku app alive called [Kaffeine](https://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/). It will allow your dyno's to sleep just enough to not bump into your monthly dyno time allowance for the Heroku free tier.

# Local Development

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

# Manual App Rename

You will need to globally replace the `RenameMe` / `rename_me` placeholder in the app with your desired app name

1. Replace all instances of `RenameMe` in the app with your app name. I use
this [Vim tool](https://github.com/brooth/far.vim) to do this.

`:Far RenameMe YourElixirModuleName **/*`

`:Fardo`

`:Far rename_me your_elixir_module_name **/*`

`:Fardo`

If you don't use Vim or prefer not to to use that plugin, you can either use an
editor of your choice or you can use the `find` command with `sed`:

`find . -type f -name '*' -exec sed -i '' s/RenameMe/YourElixirModuleName/g {} +`

`find . -type f -name '*' -exec sed -i '' s/rename_me/your_elixir_module_name/g {} +`

2. Next, rename all files. I use a tool called `rename` with `find` to do this:

`$ brew install rename`

`$ find . -execdir rename -f 's/rename_me/your_elixir_module_name/' '{}' \+ &> /dev/null`

3. Run the app!

` mix deps.get && mix phx.server`
